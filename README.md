# Stock_Predictor_App
Streamlit App for Predicting Stock Prices using historical data
/****************************************************************************************************************************/
A LSTM (long short-term memory) model was trained on the dataset fetched from yfinance (Yahoo Finance) to predict stock prices. The Stock_Prediction_App.ipynb file contains the source code for model creation, training, and testing. The trained model is saved into the files stock_model.keras and stock_model.h5 (the content of both files is the same but is used according to convenience; that is, only one is used at a time). Here in the application, I'm using h5 format. Finally, all the source code for the graphs, tables, and loading the model is saved in the file Stock_Predict_App.py. Here, I have used streamlit to deploy the app, which provides seamless integration from the Github repo to the app. Data from 2010 until present is fetched into the model.
/******************************************************************************************************************************/
To use the model, first go to the website link; the app will open with SBI's (State Bank of India) stock prediction as the default. Now go to YahooFinance.com and copy the stock ticker of the stock you want to see the prediction for (the stock ticker is usually found beside the name of the stock; for example, for SBI, SBIN.NS is the stock ticker). Finally, paste the ticker into the app and press enter. The app will load for a while and finally display the result.
